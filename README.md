# Claude Skills Library

A curated collection of high-quality skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, and tool integrations.

## 📚 What are Skills?

Skills are modular, self-contained packages that transform Claude from a general-purpose AI into a specialized agent equipped with domain-specific expertise. Think of them as "onboarding guides" that give Claude procedural knowledge for specific tasks.

### What Skills Provide

- **Specialized workflows** - Multi-step procedures for specific domains
- **Tool integrations** - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs
- **Domain expertise** - Industry-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic
- **Bundled resources** - Scripts, references, and assets for complex tasks

## 🎯 Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Use When |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| [ux-web-review](skills/ux-web-review) | Expert UX review and analysis of web applications with 10+ years of professional experience | Reviewing web apps, analyzing interfaces, providing UX feedback |

## 🚀 How to Use Skills

### Installation

   - Click "Upload Skill"

### Using Skills

Once installed, skills trigger automatically based on your requests. For example:

Each skill's README contains specific trigger phrases and usage examples.
