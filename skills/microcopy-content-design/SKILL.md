## Content Layer in Design

This skill provides the **content and communication layer** that brings design to life:

**User Research & Flows**: WHO are users, WHAT do they need?
**UX Skill**: HOW do users interact, is it usable?
**UI Skill**: Is it visually clear and precise?
**This Skill**: What does the interface SAY? Is it clear, helpful, consistent?

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: MANDATORY Context Gathering

> **STOP**: Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until context is gathered AND user has confirmed.

**CRITICAL**: Before any microcopy review or writing, ALWAYS gather context first. Choose one approach:

#### Option 1: Self-Assessment (Recommended)

Analyze the provided content and describe your understanding:

1. **Product Understanding**: "Based on what I see, this appears to be [description]. Is this correct?"
2. **User Identification**: "The primary user seems to be [role/persona]. Am I understanding this correctly?"
3. **Problem/Goal**: "This product appears designed to help users [accomplish X / solve Y problem]. Did I get that right?"
4. **System Type**: "This looks like a [SaaS dashboard / operational system / etc.]. Is that accurate?"
5. **Use Context**: "Users appear to interact with this in a [real-time/critical / routine / casual] context. Is this the intended use case?"

**DO NOT answer these questions yourself. DO NOT make assumptions. ONLY the user can provide this context.**

**WAIT**: Stop here and wait for user confirmation or correction. Do NOT proceed without user response.

#### Option 2: Designer Context Questions

Request brief context directly:

1. **Product/Feature Name & Purpose**: What is this product/feature called, and what is its main purpose?
2. **Primary User**: Who is the intended user? (role, technical level, primary goals)
3. **Problem Being Solved**: What problem or need does this address for users?
4. **System Type**: What category best describes this?
   - SaaS product / Enterprise dashboard / Operational/monitoring system / Data analytics tool / AI interface / DevOps tool / Other
5. **Use Context**: How and when will users typically interact with this?
   - Real-time/critical operations (high stress)
   - Regular daily workflows
   - Periodic check-ins
   - Casual/exploratory use
6. **Design Stage**: What stage is this design in?
   - Early concept / Mid-fidelity / High-fidelity / Near-final / Existing product revision
7. **Desired Tone of Voice (Optional)**: What tone should the copy have?
   - Professional & formal / Professional but friendly / Technical & precise / Conversational
8. **Brand Voice Guidelines (Optional)**: Are there any brand voice guidelines I should be aware of?

**DO NOT answer these questions yourself. DO NOT make assumptions. ONLY the user can provide this context.**

**WAIT**: Stop here and wait for user responses. Do NOT proceed without user response.

**DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT proceed to analysis without user response.**

### Step 2: Determine Scope

Identify what type of content work is needed:

**Microcopy Rewriting**: Improving existing copy (buttons, labels, messages)
**Tone Definition**: Establishing or refining voice and tone
**Error Messages**: Writing or improving error handling copy
**Empty States**: Creating helpful placeholder content
**System Feedback**: Status indicators, loading, success, failure messages
**Complete Copy Audit**: Reviewing all text in a flow or screen

### Step 3: Execute Based on Type

#### A. Microcopy Rewriting

When improving existing copy:

**1. Analyze Current Copy**

- What doesn't work (if anything)
- What does work
- Cognitive load assessment
- Clarity and scannability

**2. Identify Issues**

- Too long or wordy
- Unclear action or outcome
- Inconsistent tone
- Jargon or marketing speak
- Missing critical information
- Ambiguous meaning

**3. Provide Multiple Alternatives**

For each piece of copy, offer 3 versions:

**Short** (minimal, scannable):

- Fewest words possible
- For experienced users
- High-density contexts

**Clear** (balanced):

- Clear and unambiguous
- For most users
- Standard contexts

**Detailed** (helpful):

- Provides guidance
- For complex actions
- First-time or critical contexts

**4. Explain Reasoning**

- Why this wording works
- What user needs it addresses
- When to use each version

#### B. Tone & Voice Definition

When establishing tone:

**1. Define Voice Characteristics**

Choose 3-5 characteristics that fit the product and users:

**Professional Tone Options**:

- Precise and technical
- Clear and direct
- Helpful and guiding
- Confident and authoritative
- Calm and reassuring

**Avoid**:

- Marketing hype
- Overly casual
- Apologetic or weak
- Robotic or cold
- Verbose or flowery

**2. Create Tone Guidelines**

**Voice**: The personality (consistent across product)
**Tone**: The mood (varies by context)

**Example Framework**:

```
Voice: Professional, technical, helpful
Tone varies by context:
- Normal: Direct and clear
- Error: Helpful and guiding
- Success: Confident and brief
- Critical: Calm and specific
```

**3. Provide Examples**

Show tone in action across contexts:

- Button labels
- Error messages
- Empty states
- Success messages
- Help text

**4. Define Principles**

Rules for consistent writing:

- Action-oriented language
- User-centric phrasing
- Appropriate technical depth
- Consistent terminology

#### C. Error Messages

When writing error messages:

**1. Follow Error Message Framework**

Every error message should answer:

- **What happened**: Brief, accurate description
- **Why it happened**: Context (if helpful)
- **What to do**: Specific next action
- **Where to go**: Link or button if relevant

**2. Error Message Structure**

**Pattern 1: Action + Reason + Solution**

```
"Can't save changes: File name contains invalid characters. 
Remove special characters and try again."
```

**Pattern 2: Problem + Solution**

```
"Email address already exists. 
Use a different email or log in."
```

**Pattern 3: Critical + Action**

```
"Connection lost. 
Reconnecting automatically..."
```

**3. Error Types & Tone**

**User Error** (fixable):

- Helpful, not judgmental
- Clear fix action
- Example: "Password must be at least 8 characters"

**System Error** (technical):

- Apologetic but not over-apologizing
- Workaround if available
- Example: "Unable to connect to server. Check your connection or try again in a minute."

**Critical Error** (urgent):

- Calm but direct
- Immediate action needed
- Example: "Service outage detected. All deployments paused."

**4. What NOT to Do**

BAD: "An error occurred" (too vague)
BAD: "Error code 500" (no context)
BAD: "Oops! Something went wrong!" (unhelpful)
BAD: "We're sorry for the inconvenience" (over-apologizing)

GOOD: "Can't load data: Connection timed out. Retry or check network."
GOOD: "Invalid API key. Check your configuration and try again."

#### D. System Feedback & Status

When writing status messages:

**Loading States**:

- Show what's happening
- Estimate time if possible
- Keep users informed

**Examples**:

```
Short: "Loading..."
Clear: "Loading dashboard..."
Detailed: "Loading 24 widgets... This may take 30 seconds"
```

**Success States**:

- Confirm what happened
- Brief and confident
- Enable next action

**Examples**:

```
Short: "Saved"
Clear: "Changes saved successfully"
Detailed: "Alert configuration saved. All team members will be notified."
```

**Progress Indicators**:

- Specific, not generic
- Show progress when possible
- Indicate remaining time

**Examples**:

```
"Deploying to 8 servers... 3 of 8 complete"
"Analyzing 10,000 logs... 45% complete"
```

#### E. Empty States

When writing empty state copy:

**1. Empty State Components**

**Heading**: What's empty
**Body**: Why it's empty OR how to fill it
**Action**: Primary CTA to get started

**2. Empty State Types**

**First Use** (user hasn't created anything):

```
Heading: No dashboards yet
Body: Create your first dashboard to start monitoring your system
Action: [Create Dashboard]
```

**Zero State** (filtered results empty):

```
Heading: No alerts match your filters
Body: Try adjusting your date range or severity level
Action: [Clear Filters]
```

**Error State** (failed to load):

```
Heading: Unable to load dashboards
Body: We couldn't connect to the server. Check your connection and try again.
Action: [Retry]
```

**Success State** (intentionally empty):

```
Heading: All caught up!
Body: No new alerts in the last 24 hours
Action: [View History]
```

**3. Empty State Principles**

- Explain why it's empty (if not obvious)
- Provide clear next action
- Keep positive and helpful
- Match user's mental model

#### F. Buttons & Labels

When writing button copy:

**1. Button Copy Principles**

- Start with verb (action word)
- Be specific about outcome
- Keep under 3 words if possible
- Match user's mental model

**2. Common Button Patterns**

**Primary Actions**:

```
Generic: "Submit" → Specific: "Create Alert"
Generic: "OK" → Specific: "Save Changes"
Generic: "Go" → Specific: "Start Deployment"
```

**Secondary Actions**:

```
"Cancel" (standard)
"Go Back" (navigation)
"Skip" (optional steps)
"Not Now" (deferred actions)
```

**Destructive Actions**:

```
"Delete" (simple)
"Delete Account" (specific)
"Remove Access" (clear consequence)
```

**3. Button Copy Don'ts**

BAD: "Click Here"
BAD: "Yes" / "No" (without context)
BAD: "Submit Form"
BAD: Long sentences

GOOD: Action verbs
GOOD: Clear outcomes
GOOD: Specific labels
GOOD: 1-3 words

### Step 4: Structured Deliverable

Provide analysis in this format:

#### Current Copy Analysis

- What doesn't work (if anything)
- What does work
- Issues identified

#### Proposed Rewrites

- **Short version**: [minimal copy]
- **Clear version**: [balanced copy]
- **Detailed version**: [helpful copy]

#### Reasoning

- Why this wording works
- User needs it addresses
- When to use each version

#### Tone & Voice Guidance

- Recommended tone for this context
- Principles for consistency
- Examples of tone in action

#### Additional Recommendations

- Terminology consistency
- Related copy to review
- Content design best practices
