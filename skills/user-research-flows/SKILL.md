## Strategic Foundation

This skill provides the **strategic user understanding layer** that informs both UX and UI decisions:

**This Skill**: WHO are the users? WHAT do they need to accomplish? WHY?
**UX Skill**: HOW do users interact? Is it usable? Does it solve problems?
**UI Skill**: Is it visually clear? Is the execution precise?

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: MANDATORY Context Gathering

**CRITICAL**: Before any persona, journey, or flow work, ALWAYS gather context first. Choose one approach:

#### Option 1: Self-Assessment (Recommended)

Analyze the provided information and describe your understanding:

1. **Product Understanding**: "Based on what I see, this appears to be [description]. Is this correct?"
2. **User Identification**: "The primary user seems to be [role/persona]. Am I understanding this correctly?"
3. **Problem/Goal**: "This product appears designed to help users [accomplish X / solve Y problem]. Did I get that right?"
4. **System Type**: "This looks like a [SaaS dashboard / operational system / etc.]. Is that accurate?"
5. **Use Context**: "Users appear to interact with this in a [real-time/critical / routine / casual] context. Is this the intended use case?"

Wait for user confirmation or correction before proceeding.

#### Option 2: Designer Context Questions

Request brief context directly:

1. **Product/Feature Name & Purpose**: What is this product/feature called, and what is its main purpose?
2. **Primary User**: Who is the intended user? (role, technical level, primary goals)
3. **Problem Being Solved**: What problem or need does this address for users?
4. **System Type**: What category best describes this?
   - SaaS product / Enterprise dashboard / Operational/monitoring system / Data analytics tool / AI interface / DevOps tool / Other
5. **Use Context**: How and when will users typically interact with this?
   - Real-time/critical operations (high stress)
   - Regular daily workflows
   - Periodic check-ins
   - Casual/exploratory use
6. **Design Stage**: What stage is this design in?
   - Early concept / Mid-fidelity prototype / High-fidelity mockup / Near-final design / Existing product needing revision
7. **Existing Personas (Optional)**: Do you already have defined personas, or should I help create them?

Wait for user responses before proceeding.

### Step 2: Determine Scope

Based on the request, identify what's needed:

**Persona Building**: Creating or refining user personas
**Journey Mapping**: Mapping end-to-end user journeys
**Flow Design**: Designing specific task flows
**Combined Approach**: Multiple elements together

### Step 3: Execute Based on Scope

#### A. Persona Building

When building personas:

**1. Clarify User Segments**
- Identify distinct user types
- Define primary vs secondary personas
- Establish role, experience level, technical proficiency

**2. Develop Strong Personas**

For each persona, define:

**Demographics & Role**:
- Job title and responsibilities
- Technical proficiency level
- Experience with similar systems
- Team size and structure

**Goals & Motivations**:
- Primary objectives (what they're trying to achieve)
- Success metrics (how they measure success)
- Motivations (why they care)
- Constraints (what limits them)

**Context & Environment**:
- Where they work (office, remote, NOC, field)
- When they use the system (24/7, business hours, ad-hoc)
- Device/platform preferences
- Stress level during use

**Pain Points & Barriers**:
- Current frustrations
- Workflow interruptions
- Technical limitations
- Organizational constraints

**Behavioral Patterns**:
- How they make decisions
- Information they prioritize
- Communication preferences

**Drivers & Triggers**:
- What prompts action
- Urgency factors
- Dependencies on others
- External pressures

**3. Validate & Refine**
- Ensure personas are distinct (not overlapping)
- Ground in real user research if available
- Make actionable (guide design decisions)
- Avoid superficial or generic personas

#### B. User Journey Mapping

When mapping journeys:

**1. Define Journey Scope**
- Start point (trigger)
- End point (goal achieved)
- Boundary (what's in/out of scope)

**2. Map Complete Journey**

For each journey, include:

**Trigger**: What starts this journey?
- User-initiated or system-initiated
- Urgency level
- Context leading to trigger

**Stages**: Major phases of the journey
- Awareness
- Consideration
- Action
- Completion
- Follow-up (if applicable)

**Steps**: Specific actions per stage
- What user does
- What system does
- Data/information exchanged
- Dependencies

**Touchpoints**: Where user interacts
- Interfaces (web, mobile, CLI, API)
- Channels (email, Slack, dashboard)
- Tools (integrated systems)

**Thoughts & Emotions**: User mental state
- What they're thinking
- How they're feeling (frustrated, confident, anxious)
- Decision-making process
- Confidence level

**Pain Points**: Friction in journey
- Where things slow down
- Where confusion occurs
- Where errors happen
- Where users need help

**Opportunities**:
- Automation possibilities
- AI assistance points
- Simplification opportunities
- Proactive guidance

**3. Analyze & Improve**
- Identify critical paths
- Find drop-off points
- Highlight areas for optimization
- Propose journey improvements

#### C. Flow Design & Planning

When designing flows:

**1. Define Flow Scope**
- Specific task or feature
- Entry point
- Exit points (success, error, cancel)

**2. Create Flow Structure**

**Linear Flow** (sequential steps):
```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Complete
```
- When: Simple, mandatory sequence
- Example: Onboarding, checkout, setup wizard

**Branching Flow** (conditional paths):
```
Step 1 → Decision Point
         ├─ Path A → Step 2A → Complete
         └─ Path B → Step 2B → Step 3B → Complete
```
- When: User choices affect path
- Example: Configuration, troubleshooting, advanced vs simple mode

**Hub Flow** (central point):
```
Dashboard (hub) ↔ Feature 1
                ↔ Feature 2
                ↔ Feature 3
```
- When: Multiple independent tasks
- Example: Admin dashboard, control panel

**Parallel Flow** (simultaneous paths):
```
Start → [Task A + Task B + Task C] → Sync Point → Complete
```
- When: Multiple actions can happen concurrently
- Example: Bulk operations, multi-resource provisioning

**3. Specify Each Step**

For each step in the flow:
- **Action**: What user does
- **System Response**: What happens
- **Context Provided**: Information shown
- **Decisions**: Choices user makes
- **Validation**: Checks performed
- **Error Handling**: What if something fails
- **Next Step**: Where user goes

**4. Identify Optimization Opportunities**

**Automation**: What can be automated?
**Smart Defaults**: What can be pre-filled?
**Context Awareness**: What can system infer?
**AI Assistance**: Where can AI help?
**Progressive Disclosure**: What can be hidden until needed?

**5. Define Edge Cases**
- Empty states
- Error states
- Loading states
- Partial completion
- Recovery paths

### Step 4: Structured Deliverable

#### User Understanding
- Who they are
- Why they're here
- What they're trying to accomplish

#### Key User Goals
- Primary objectives
- Success criteria
- Priority ranking

#### Relevant User Journey (if applicable)
- Full journey map with stages
- Touchpoints and interactions

## Analysis Principles

### Tone & Approach
- Professional, sharp, experience-based
- Focused on building practical, not theoretical, products
- Always with examples and applicable insights
- Emphasizes what users really need, not what product wants

### Quality Standards
- No weak or generic personas (must be clear and distinct)
- No superficial journeys (include actions, thoughts, emotions, context)
- Every recommendation based on user behavior, not feeling
- No empty buzzwords
- Always refer to complex systems context
- Operative directions for execution

### When to Ask Questions
