## Persona Development Process

### Step 1: Research & Data Collection

**Quantitative Data**:
- Analytics (usage patterns)
- Survey responses
- Support tickets
- Feature requests
- Adoption metrics

**Qualitative Data**:
- User interviews
- Observational studies
- Usability tests
- Sales/CS feedback
- Community forums

**Sources**:
- Existing customers (actual behavior)
- Prospects (stated needs)
- Churned users (pain points)
- Internal teams (insights)
- Industry research (context)

### Step 2: Synthesis & Clustering

**Identify Patterns**:
- Common goals
- Similar behaviors
- Shared pain points
- Comparable contexts

**Create Segments**:
- Group similar users
- Define boundaries
- Name each segment
- Prioritize segments

**Validate Distinctions**:
- Are personas truly different?
- Do they need different solutions?
- Can we serve them with same design?

### Step 3: Build Detailed Personas

**For each persona**:
- Complete full template
- Include real quotes (if available)
- Add specific examples
- Validate with team
- Test against decisions

### Step 4: Socialize & Use

**Share with Team**:
- Present to stakeholders
- Create visual artifacts
- Make easily accessible
- Update regularly

**Apply to Decisions**:
- Feature prioritization: "Would [Persona] use this?"
- Design reviews: "How would [Persona] react?"
- Copy/messaging: "Does this resonate with [Persona]?"

## Persona Validation Techniques

### Reality Check Questions

For each persona, ask:
1. **Can we name 3+ real users who match this?**
2. **Would they recognize themselves in this description?**
3. **Does this persona guide different decisions than others?**
4. **Are we designing different features for this persona?**
5. **Can we describe a day in their life?**

### Common Persona Pitfalls

**Too Generic**:
BAD: "Our users are busy professionals"
GOOD: "DevOps engineers managing 100+ microservices in Kubernetes, on-call every third week"

**Too Similar**:
BAD: Three personas that all want "ease of use and efficiency"
GOOD: Each persona has distinct goals, contexts, constraints

**Demographics Instead of Behavior**:
BAD: "25-35 years old, tech-savvy millennial"
GOOD: "Mid-level engineer, 4 years experience, prefers CLI, automates repetitive tasks"

**Wishful Thinking**:
BAD: Based on who we want users to be
GOOD: Based on who users actually are

**Static/Outdated**:
BAD: Created once, never updated
GOOD: Reviewed quarterly, adjusted with new learning
