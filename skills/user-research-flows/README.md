# User Research & Flows Skill

Expert consultant in user research, persona development, user journey mapping, and flow design for complex systems with 10+ years of experience.

## What This Skill Does

Transforms Claude into an expert user research consultant who provides the **strategic user understanding layer** that informs both UX and UI decisions. The skill covers:

- Persona development for power users and technical professionals
- User journey mapping for complex, multi-step processes
- Flow design for operational systems (NOC, DevOps, observability)
- Understanding needs in high-stress, real-time environments
- Research methodologies for enterprise and B2B contexts
- AI assistant integration into existing workflows

## Strategic Foundation

This skill provides the foundational understanding that guides design:

**This Skill**: WHO are the users? WHAT do they need? WHY?
**UX Skill**: HOW do users interact? Is it usable? Does it solve problems?
**UI Skill**: Is it visually clear? Is the execution precise?

## Who It's For

- **Product Managers** defining user needs and priorities
- **Product Designers** understanding users before designing
- **UX Researchers** conducting or planning research
- **Design Teams** building personas and journeys
- **Founders** validating assumptions about users

## When To Use

Trigger this skill by saying:

- "Create a persona for..."
- "Map the user journey for..."
- "Design the user flow for..."
- "Who are our users?"
- "What do users need to accomplish?"

Works with:

- Product descriptions
- Feature requirements
- User research data
- Existing designs (to understand users)

## Key Features

### Mandatory Context Gathering

Before any persona/journey/flow work, Claude asks questions to understand:

- What your product does
- Who your users are
- What problems you're solving
- What context users operate in

This ensures relevant, grounded work tailored to your situation.

### Persona Building

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating a Persona

```text
You: I'm building a monitoring tool for DevOps engineers. 
     Can you help me create a persona?

Claude: [Asks context questions first]
        To create an accurate persona, I need some context:
        
        1. What does your monitoring tool specifically do?
        2. What problem does it solve for DevOps engineers?
        3. What systems/tools would they typically use?
        
You: It monitors microservices in Kubernetes, alerts on 
     issues, helps with troubleshooting...

Claude: [Creates detailed persona]
        
        Name: Jordan Martinez
        Role: Senior DevOps Engineer / SRE
        Company: Mid-market SaaS (500 employees)
        Experience: 7 years in DevOps/infrastructure
        Technical Level: Expert
        
        Quote: "I need to know what's broken before 
                customers tell me"
        
        Goals:
        - Maintain 99.95% uptime
        - Reduce MTTR (mean time to recovery)
        - Automate repetitive troubleshooting
        - Improve system observability
        
        Pain Points:
        - Too many alerts (alert fatigue)
        - Correlation across multiple systems is manual
        - Difficult to prove ROI of reliability work
        - Legacy monitoring has gaps
        
        Behaviors:
        - CLI-first, keyboard shortcuts essential
        - Multiple monitors with dashboards
        - Checks Slack alerts constantly
        - Documents in runbooks for team
        
        Design Implications:
        - Fast, information-dense interface
        - Powerful filtering and search
        - Keyboard shortcuts essential
        - API access for automation
        - Integrate with PagerDuty/Slack
```text

### Example 2: Mapping a User Journey

```text
You: Map the user journey for responding to a production 
     incident

Claude: [After context gathering]
        
        JOURNEY: Production Incident Response
        PERSONA: DevOps Engineer (on-call)
        TRIGGER: PagerDuty alert at 2 AM
        GOAL: Restore service, prevent recurrence
        
        STAGE 1: Alert & Triage (2-5 minutes)
        
        Step 1: Receive alert
        - User: Woken by phone buzzing
        - System: PagerDuty notification
        - Thinks: "How bad is this?"
        - Feels: Startled, adrenaline spike
        - Pain: Alert doesn't show severity clearly
        
        Step 2: Check dashboard
        - User: Opens laptop, loads monitoring
        - System: Shows system status
        - Thinks: "What's actually down?"
        - Feels: Anxious, trying to assess
        - Pain: Takes 30 sec to load, unclear what to check first
        
        Step 3: Determine severity
        - User: Checks error rates, customer impact
        - System: Multiple dashboards
        - Thinks: "Do I escalate or handle this?"
        - Feels: Pressure to make right call
        - Pain: No single view of customer impact
        
        STAGE 2: Investigation (10-30 minutes)
        [Detailed breakdown continues...]
        
        OPPORTUNITIES:
        - AI-powered initial triage: "API Gateway is down, 
          affects 40% of users, recommend immediate escalation"
        - Pre-populated runbook based on alert type
        - One-click war room setup (Slack channel, Zoom link)
        - Automatic customer-facing status page update
```text

### Example 3: Designing a Flow

```text
You: Design the flow for configuring alert thresholds

Claude: [After context]
        
        FLOW: Configure Alert Thresholds
        TYPE: Branching Flow (smart defaults + advanced)
        
        ENTRY: From Settings > Alerts
        
        BASIC PATH (Recommended for most users):
        
        Step 1: Select Metric
        - Action: Choose from dropdown (CPU, Memory, Errors, etc.)
        - System: Shows current baseline for context
        - Smart Default: Pre-selects most relevant metric
        
        Step 2: Choose Preset
        - Action: Select severity level (Critical/Warning/Info)
        - System: Shows recommended thresholds
        - Smart Default: Based on industry standards
        - Example: CPU Critical: >90% for 5min
        
        Step 3: Set Alert Destination
        - Action: Choose notification channel (Slack, PagerDuty)
        - System: Shows available integrations
        - Smart Default: Team's primary channel
        
        Step 4: Preview & Confirm
        - Shows: What will trigger, where notifications go
        - Action: Enable alert
        - Done: 3 steps, ~30 seconds
        
        ADVANCED PATH (For power users):
        
        [Show Advanced Options]
        
        Step 2a: Custom Threshold
        - Precise value entry
        - Multiple conditions (AND/OR)
        - Time windows
        - Anomaly detection options
        
        Step 3a: Advanced Routing
        - Escalation policies
        - Time-based routing
        - Conditional routing
        
        ERROR HANDLING:
        - Invalid threshold: "Value must be 0-100%"
        - No channel: Require at least one destination
        - Save draft if user exits
        
        OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
        - AI suggests thresholds based on historical data
        - Templates for common alert patterns
        - Bulk configuration for similar metrics
        - Test alert before enabling
