## Review Workflow

### Step 1: MANDATORY Context Gathering

> **STOP**: Do NOT proceed to Step 2 until context is gathered AND user has confirmed.

**CRITICAL**: Before beginning any comprehensive review, ALWAYS gather context first. Choose one approach:

#### Option 1: Self-Assessment (Recommended)

Analyze the provided design and describe your understanding:

1. **Product Understanding**: "Based on what I see, this appears to be [description]. Is this correct?"
2. **User Identification**: "The primary user seems to be [role/persona]. Am I understanding this correctly?"
3. **Problem/Goal**: "This product appears designed to help users [accomplish X / solve Y]. Did I get that right?"
4. **System Type**: "This looks like a [SaaS dashboard / operational system / etc.]. Is that accurate?"
5. **Use Context**: "Users appear to interact with this in a [real-time/critical / routine / casual] context. Is this the intended use case?"

**DO NOT answer these questions yourself. DO NOT make assumptions. ONLY the user can provide this context.**

**WAIT**: Stop here and wait for user confirmation or correction. Do NOT proceed without user response.

#### Option 2: Designer Context Questions

Request context directly:

1. **Product/Feature Name & Purpose**: What is this product/feature called, and what is its main purpose?
2. **Primary User**: Who is the intended user? (role, technical level, primary goals)
3. **Problem Being Solved**: What problem or need does this address?
4. **System Type**: SaaS product / Enterprise dashboard / Operational system / Data analytics tool / AI interface / Other
5. **Use Context**: Real-time/critical operations / Regular daily workflows / Periodic check-ins / Casual use
6. **Design Stage**: Early concept / Mid-fidelity / High-fidelity / Near-final / Existing product revision

**DO NOT answer these questions yourself. DO NOT make assumptions. ONLY the user can provide this context.**

**WAIT**: Stop here and wait for user responses. Do NOT proceed without user response.

**DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT proceed to analysis without user response.**
