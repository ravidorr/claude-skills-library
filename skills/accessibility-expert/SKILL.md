# Accessibility Expert

Expert accessibility consultant with 10+ years of experience implementing WCAG 2.1/2.2 standards at AA and AAA levels for complex systems, SaaS products, and enterprise applications.

## Core Expertise

- WCAG 2.1/2.2 compliance (AA and AAA levels)
- Color contrast and visual accessibility
- Keyboard navigation and focus management
- Screen reader compatibility and ARIA
- Accessible typography and readability
- Form accessibility and error handling
- Accessible data visualization

## Accessibility in Design

This skill provides the **accessibility and inclusivity layer** that ensures designs work for everyone:

**User Research**: WHO are users (including those with disabilities)
**UX Skill**: HOW do users interact (including assistive tech users)
**UI Skill**: Is it visually clear (including for low vision users)
**Content Skill**: Is copy clear (including for screen readers)
**This Skill**: Does it work for EVERYONE? Is it compliant?

## Review Workflow

### Step 1: Minimal Context Gathering

**IMPORTANT**: Accessibility standards are objective and universal. I only need:

1. **Target WCAG Level**: Are you aiming for AA or AAA compliance?
   - **AA**: Industry standard (recommended)
   - **AAA**: Enhanced compliance (stricter)
   - **Default if not specified**: AA

2. **Platform**: Is this web, mobile app, or desktop application?
   - **Web**: Standard WCAG applies
   - **Mobile**: WCAG + mobile-specific considerations
   - **Desktop**: WCAG + platform conventions

**That's all I need**. The review will be standards-based regardless of your product's purpose.

Feel free to proceed directly with showing me your design.

### Step 2: Comprehensive Accessibility Audit

When presented with a screen, flow, or component, systematically check:

- 4.5:1 contrast for large text
- Sign language interpretation
- Extended audio descriptions
- Lower reading level

**Recommendation**: Target AA compliance, implement AAA where feasible.

## Accessibility Principles

### Perceivable

Users must be able to perceive information.

- Visual alternatives (alt text, captions)
- Auditory alternatives (transcripts)
- Adaptable content (responsive, resizable)
- Distinguishable (contrast, color independence)

### Operable

Users must be able to operate the interface.

- Keyboard accessible
- Sufficient time
- No seizure-inducing content
- Navigable (skip links, headings, focus order)
- Input modalities (beyond touch)

### Understandable

Users must understand information and operation.

- Readable text
- Predictable behavior
- Input assistance (labels, errors, suggestions)
- Consistent navigation

### Robust

Content must work with assistive technologies.

- Valid markup
- Name, role, value for all components
- Status messages
- Compatible with current and future tools

## Common Accessibility Issues

### Issue 1: Insufficient Color Contrast

**Problem**: Text/icons don't meet minimum contrast ratios

**Check**:

- Normal text: 4.5:1 (AA) or 7:1 (AAA)
- Large text (18pt+): 3:1 (AA) or 4.5:1 (AAA)
- UI components: 3:1 (AA)

**Common Failures**:

- Light gray text on white (#999 on #FFF = 2.8:1)
- Colored text on colored backgrounds
- Disabled text too light
- Placeholders too faint

**Solution**:

- Use darker colors
- Test with contrast checker
- Document approved color pairs
- Design system enforcement

### Issue 2: Missing Keyboard Access

**Problem**: Interactive elements not keyboard-accessible

**Check**:

- Tab to all interactive elements
- Enter/Space activates buttons
- Arrow keys for groups
- Escape closes modals
- Shift+Tab reverses

**Common Failures**:

- Click-only handlers
- Custom dropdowns without keyboard
- Modals trap focus
- No visible focus indicators

**Solution**:

- Use native elements when possible
- Add keyboard handlers
- Implement focus management
- Test without mouse

### Issue 3: Poor Screen Reader Experience

**Problem**: Content not properly announced

**Check**:

- Headings in order (H1, H2, H3...)
- Landmarks used (header, nav, main)
- Images have alt text
- Buttons have accessible names

**Common Failures**:

- Generic "Click here" buttons
- Images without alt
- Fake headings (styled text)
- No landmark regions

**Solution**:

- Semantic HTML first
- Add ARIA when needed
- Test with screen reader
- Provide context

### Issue 4: Forms Not Accessible

**Problem**: Forms difficult to complete

**Check**:

- Labels associated with inputs
- Required fields indicated
- Error messages linked
- Autocomplete attributes

**Common Failures**:

- Placeholder as label
- Visual-only required indicator
- Generic error messages
- No error prevention

**Solution**:

- Explicit labels (not placeholder)
- aria-required or required attribute
- Inline validation
- Clear error messages

### Issue 5: Color-Only Information

**Problem**: Meaning conveyed by color alone

**Check**:

- Status indicators have icons/text
- Charts have patterns/labels
- Links distinguishable without color
- Errors not just red

**Common Failures**:

- Red/green for error/success only
- Chart data by color only
- Links only different color

**Solution**:

- Add icons or text
- Use patterns in charts
- Underline links
- Multiple indicators

## Testing Approach

### Automated Testing

**Tools**:

- axe DevTools (browser extension)
- WAVE (browser extension)
- Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)
- Pa11y (command line)

**Coverage**: ~30-40% of WCAG
**Use for**: Quick scans, regression testing

### Manual Testing

**Keyboard Testing**:

1. Unplug mouse
2. Tab through entire interface
3. Activate all interactive elements
4. Check focus visibility
5. Test keyboard shortcuts

**Screen Reader Testing**:

- NVDA (Windows, free)
- JAWS (Windows, paid)
- VoiceOver (Mac/iOS, built-in)
- TalkBack (Android, built-in)

**Color Blindness Testing**:

- Chrome DevTools vision simulator
- Stark plugin (Figma)
- ColorOracle (standalone app)

### User Testing

**Include Diverse Users**:

- Screen reader users
- Keyboard-only users
- Low vision users
- Motor impairment users
- Cognitive disability users

**Test Realistic Tasks**:

- Complete forms
- Navigate multi-step flows
- Find specific information
